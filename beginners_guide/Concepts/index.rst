Concepts
========
The Satisfactory architecture uses multiple concepts, structures and subsystems to provide functionality and optimization to the game.
As a modder you need to know how they work and how they interact with each other in order to write mods that add new functionality to the game.
This section also contains information on general Unreal Engine concepts to help beginners.

This is key, not only for registering new Items but also for interacting with existing features like the power system without needing to implement all of it over and over again.

If you'd like, you can move on to the `Create a Simple Mod <Create a Simple Mod>`_ section, but we suggest you read through at least a few of these as they will help you understand the Simple Mod tutorial on a deeper level and better prepare you for writing your own mods.
