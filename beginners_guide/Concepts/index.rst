Satisfactory Concepts
=====================
The satisfactory architecture uses multiple Concepts, Structures and Subsystem to provide functionality and optimization to the game.
As a modder you need to know how they work and how the interact with each other to provide great new functionality.

This is key, not only for registering new Items but also for interacting with existing features like the power system without needing to implement all of it over and over again.
