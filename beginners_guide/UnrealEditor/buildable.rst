Buildable
=========
A buildable is simply something you will be able to place with the build gun. Even if it ist just a foundation, it is still a ``FGBuildable``.

Making the Actor
================
Making a buildable is pretty easy. Itself is a actor with just a bit more default values.
This time we create a own folder for the buildable to have textures, meshes and so on in one place.
Create it in a new folder called "Buildables" in the mod-root-folder, and call it self f.e. "DocBuild". Create the actor class of type ``FGBuildable`` with f.e. the name "Build_DocBuild".
