Create a Simple Mod
===================
Now that you have learned the core concepts of Satisfactory modding, you can get started on creating your first mod.

To get started, this tutorial will walk you through creating a simple mod that adds the following:
- The required core functions that register the mod with the game and allow its content to be added
- A custom recipe to make 1 Wood from 42 Leaves
- A new item, an ingot called a 'Doc Ingot'
- A new buildable object that can be painted with the paint gun
- A basic machine that consumes power and counts the number and types of items that pass through it
These are listed in order of easiest to most difficult.

.. hint:: Knowledge about 3D modeling is very helpful if you want to add new items, buildings, enemies, etc. to the game. If you have an idea for such a mod but aren't experienced with modeling, consider posting it in the ``#ideas-discussion`` channel `Discord server <https://discord.gg/xkVJ73E>`_ or on the `SMR Forums <https://forums.ficsit.app/>`_. You may find an artist willing to help you. You could also learn how to model in a program like Blender, Meshmixer, Maya, etc.
