Dependencies
############
To get started with modding of satisfactory you need multiple things.

- Satisfactory
- Unreal Engine 4 (v4.21)
- Visual Studio >= 2015
- Visual C++ 15
- Wwise
- Satisfactory Mod Loader (``xinput1_3.dll``)

.. tip:: If you want to code something in C++, you also need the Satisfactory Mod Loader Source

To much? Don't worry, we will guide you through each step of downloading and installing these dependencies.

Satisfactory
''''''''''''
This should be straight forward. Just buy, download and install Satisfactory from the Epic Games Launcher. And then try to play it.

.. hint:: You should **not** use the Experimental version of the game. Cause you would need to update the SF Source Code quite often.

Unreal Engine 4
'''''''''''''''
This is much easier than you might think.
Again, just go into the Epic Games Launcher and then select the Unreal Engine tab at the left-hand side of the launcher.
Then click on the Download button in the upper right-hand corner.
A window should pop-up and ask you what version you want to download. Select the current engine version of satisfactory, 4.21.
Also, remember to select your wanted installation folder.

.. warning:: Unreal Engine 4 is quite big, especially if you want to install the source and the debug code. You should be really sure where you want to install Unreal.

Visual Studio
'''''''''''''
Visit the `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.com/>`_ Page and select ``Community`` under ``Visual Studio-IDE``/``Download Visual Studio``, then download the installer.
Now when you opened it, click again on Visual Studio Community and keep the default settings.
Hit Install and wait until the Installation process finished.

Visual C++ 15
'''''''''''''
This is just important for users of Visual Studio 2019. Cause VS 17 should have already installed what you need.
Open the visual studio installer again and click on the ``change`` button of your installation.
If not already selected, select ``Desktop development with C++``.
Now open the sidebar on the right-hand side and select under ``Desktop development with C++`` the option ``VS 2015 C++-Buildtools``.
Hit save and wait until the installation process finished.

Wwise
'''''
Visit `Wwise.com <https://wwise.com/>`_ and click on the ``Get Wwise`` -> ``download Wwise`` button in the upper right corner.
Now the website should ask you to log in. Click on ``Sign in`` and follow the given steps.
After you finished downloading Wwise, open the installer and start with installing the WWise launcher.

Satisfactory Mod Loader
'''''''''''''''''''''''
This extremly straight forward. Just visit `ficsit.app <https://ficsit.app/>`_, open up the menu and click on SML.
Then just download SML version your mod should use, we recommend always the newest one, and then move the downloaded ``xinput1_3.dll`` file into your Satisfactory installation folder under ``Binaries/Win64`` and you're done!
