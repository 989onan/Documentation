# Satisfactory Modding Documentation
Documentation for SML and Unreal modding.

Pages are written in reStructuredText format and compiled into html documents with Sphinx.

To build, you'll also need to install [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) and the [ReadTheDocs Sphnix theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

To build for web, run `./make.bat html`.

A reStructuredText quick reference can be found [here](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#inline-markup).
