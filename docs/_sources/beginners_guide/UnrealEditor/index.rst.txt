Unreal Editor
=============
The Unreal Editor got install with the Unreal Engine it self.
This is your IDE where you will spent most time in to add especially "visible" content called ``assets``.
But it's also used to add simple logic to your mod with a integrated visual programming language called ``BluePrints``.

.. Tip:: If you want to learn more about ``BluePrints`` and the so called ``UObject-System`` we recommend you the concept pages for `BluePrints <../Concepts/BluePrints.rst>`_ and the `UObject-System <../Concepts/UObject.rst>`_.

.. Hint:: We recommend the `Unreal Academy <https://acadamy.unrealengine.com/>`_ for learning more about the concepts and deep topics of Unreal Engine it self (like Particle System, advanced BluePrints, and so on)
