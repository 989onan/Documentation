Concepts
========
The satisfactory architecture uses multiple concepts, structures and subsystems to provide functionality and optimization to the game.
As a modder you need to know how they work and how they interact with each other to provide great new functionality.
But this section also contains information of general concepts for Unreal Engine to help beginners.

This is key, not only for registering new Items but also for interacting with existing features like the power system without needing to implement all of it over and over again.
