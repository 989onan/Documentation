Unreal Editor
-------------

The Unreal Editor got install with the Unreal Engine it self. This is
your IDE where you will spend the most time in to add especially
"visible" content called `assets`. But it's also used to add simple
logic to your mod with an integrated visual programming language called
`BluePrints`.

If you want to learn more about `BluePrints` and the so called
`UObject-System` we recommend you the concept pages for
link:../Concepts/BluePrints.rst[BluePrints] and the
link:../Concepts/UObject.rst[UObject-System].

We recommend the https://academy.unrealengine.com/[Unreal Academy] for
learning more about the concepts and deep topics of Unreal Engine itself
(like Particle System, advanced BluePrints, and so on)
