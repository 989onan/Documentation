= Recipe vs Schematic

'Recipes' are used to define the item input/cost and output of crafting
items, buildables, etc. Recipes are not only used for the craft bench or
the workshop, but also for the build gun, smelters, manufacturers and
more.

[TIP]
====
Note that recipes are used to define both crafting recipes in the craft
bench and machines _and_ construction prices when using the build gun.
All buildables actually have an item equivalent in game as well.

'Schematics' define
https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Milestones[Milestones], the shipments
submitted to FICSIT via the HUB in order to unlock new recipes and
features.

== Initial Mod Setup

To keep your folder structure organized, let's create a folder where all
of your mod content will go.

Create a folder, for example,`+Content/FactoryGame/DocMod+`, to serve as
your mod-project-root. All of the assets for our mod will go in this
folder and will be turned into a pak when we're done.

== Create a Recipe

First of all, we want to add a recipe to the game which will get
unlocked with the schematic we will create afterwards. Create a folder,
`+Content/FactoryGame/DocMod/Recipes+` which will contain all our
recipes.

Now, back in Unreal, we can create a new BP Class in this folder which
extends `+FGRecipe+` to serve as our recipe.

Finally, we can define the recipe description itself. Open up the class
and go to the class defaults and set the properties to the values you
want.

* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  If you want to define a name for your recipe, check this and type the
  name in. For our tutorial recipe, we'll check it and call it "Doc
  Recipe"
* {blank}
+
M Ingredients::
  This is an array of structs, each of which contains the information of
  one crafting component. Together, the array forms the input items for
  the recipe. For this example, we'll add one entry and set
  `+Desc_Leaves+` as the `+Item Class+` and 42 as the `+Amount+`.
* {blank}
+
M Manufacturing Duration::
  This determines the time it takes for a machine to process this
  recipe. It also corresponds to the number of clicks required to craft
  the recipe at a crafting station. We'll keep it at 1 for now, cuz we
  are super speedy pioneers. TODO Find out seconds here to clicks in
  bench ratio, probably 1 to 1
* {blank}
+
M Produced In::
  Here we need to select the machine that can use the recipe, for
  example, `+FGWorkBench+`.
* {blank}
+
M Product::
  This is again an array of structs containing information regarding the
  item types and amounts that form the output of recipe. In our case
  we'll add an entry with `+Desc_Wood+` as the `+Item Class+` and 1 as
  the `+Amount+`

[WARNING]
====
Note that although recipes with more than out output item type will
still compile and load properly, they will crash the game if you try to
use them, even if you were to make a modded machine with more than one
output to craft it in. If you'd like to make a recipe with more than one
output, ask for help with this on the discord, as the only way to do
this right now is a bit roundabout until Coffee Stain makes such recipes
not crash the game.
====

Ok, now you've created your first recipe! Next, let's add it to a
schematic to make it available ingame.

== Create a Schematic

Schematics are what Satisfactory uses to grant additional recipes and
capabilities to the player. Schematics are the 'package' groupings
you'll see in the HUB that have rewards associated with them. You'll
note that even though alternate recipes are researched at the MAM, you
still need to submit items at the HUB to unlock the milestone associated
with them. Schematics are also used for the Tier 0 tutorial phases. To
get started, create a folder in your main mod folder for your
schematics, for example, `+Content/FactoryGame/DocMod/Schematics+`.

Inside this folder create again a new BP Class but this time of type
`+FGSchematic+` and f.e. with the name "Schem_Doc". Open it and go again
to its defaults.

* {blank}
+
M Type::
  The type of the schematic, which determines if it's part of the
  tutorial system or if it's a Milestone. We'll use `+hub upgrade+`
  because we don't want our schematic to be part of the tutorial phase.
* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  The in-game name of our schematic exactly as it is displayed to the
  user, for example, "Doc Hub Upgrade".
* {blank}
+
M Schematic Category::
  Defines the category in which this schematic gets grouped into. Go
  ahead and pick one; it doesn't matter for our example.
* {blank}
+
M Tech Tier::
  Determines which Tier the schematic will appear under in the HUB.
  We'll set it to 1 so that our content is available as soon as you
  finish the tutorial.
* {blank}
+
M Schematic Icon::
  The icon displayed on the schematic in the HUB. We can use
  link:Icon_SchemDoc.png[this example image].
* {blank}
+
M Depends on Schematic::
  Setting this option will require the selected schematic to be
  activated first before this one can be activated. We'll leave this
  empty because we don't our content to require any other particular
  schematic to be unlocked first.
* {blank}
+
M Additional Schematic Dependencies::
  Similar to `+M Depends on Schematic+`. Additional schematics to be
  dependent on can be listed here.
* {blank}
+
M Cost::
  A list of item amounts which are needed to activate the schematic in
  the HUB. We'll add two entries, one with 100 `+Desc_Leaves+` and
  another one with 100 `+FGWood+`
* {blank}
+
M Ship Travel Time after Purchase::
  Determines how long in seconds the HUB will wait before allowing the
  player to submit another milestone after completing this one. We'll
  set this to 100 so that the drop pod will fly away for 100 seconds.
* {blank}
+
M Recipes::
  The list of Recipes which will get unlocked when the player completes
  this schematic. Here we'll add our `+Desc_DocRecipe+` from before as
  an entry.
* {blank}
+
M Resources to Add to Scanner::
  A list of resource types which should get added to the resource
  scanner when this schematic gets unlocked. We don't need to add
  anything here.
* {blank}
+
M Unlocks Map::
  If this schematic unlocks the in-game map feature. Why should your
  schematic do that? So no, leave it unchecked.
* {blank}
+
M Unlocks Build Efficiency::
  If this schematic unlocks the build efficiency display. Again, leave
  it alone.
* {blank}
+
M Unlocks build Overclock::
  If this schematic unlocks the ability to overclock buildings. Ours
  doesn't, so we can leave it as is.
* {blank}
+
M Num Inventory Slots to Unlock::
  The number of additional main inventory slots to grant the player.
  We'll put 0.
* {blank}
+
M Arm Equipment Slots to Unlock::
  The number of additional arm equipment slots to grant the player.
  Another 0 here.
* {blank}
+
M Include In Builds::
  Set this to 'public builds' so that your content is included in the
  build. Presumably, this is what Coffee Stain uses to keep their
  developer milestones made for testing from being shipping with the
  main game.

Finally! What a class. Now we just need to register this schematic in
the runtime.

== Register the Schematic

Registering a schematic works by using the schematic manager subsystem.
To register now a schematic you can simply call the
`+Add Available Schematic+` node with the schematic class as input.
Problem is, if you were to do just this, every time `+PostInit+` of the
`+InitMod+` is called (for example when the game loads) the schematic
will be added multiple times and show up in the HUB multiple times. To
prevent this, we need to check if the schematic is already "registered"
by getting the available and purchased schematics list with the
corresponding `+GetAvailableSchematics+` and `+GetPurchasedSchematics+`
and then we search for our schematic. If it is *not* in one of these
lists, then trigger the node to add it.

[TIP]
====
If you accidentally clutter up a savegame with duplicates of a
milestone, you can remove the duplicates using a savegame editor such as
one found on https://ficsit.app/tools[the ficsit.app tools page].

[TIP]
====
The SML example mod's `+ModInit+` class contains a good and dynamic
implementation of this, which simply iterates over an array of classes
which contains the schematics to register.
====

And we're set! Our recipe and schematic are registered and should
show up in the game now.
