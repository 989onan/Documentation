Concepts
--------

The Satisfactory architecture uses multiple concepts, structures and
subsystems to provide functionality and optimization to the game. As a
modder you need to know how they work and how they interact with each
other in order to write mods that add new functionality to the game.
This section also contains information on general Unreal Engine concepts
to help beginners.

This is key, not only for registering new Items but also for interacting
with existing features like the power system without needing to
implement all of it over and over again.

If you'd like, you can move on to the
link:Create%20a%20Simple%20Mod[Create a Simple Mod] section, but we
suggest you read through at least a few of these as they will help you
understand the Simple Mod tutorial on a deeper level and better prepare
you for writing your own mods.
