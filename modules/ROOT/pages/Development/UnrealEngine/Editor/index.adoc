= Unreal Editor

The Unreal Editor got install with the Unreal Engine it self. This is
your IDE where you will spend the most time in to add especially
"visible" content called `assets`. But it's also used to add simple
logic to your mod with an integrated visual programming language called
`BluePrints`.

[TIP]
====
If you want to learn more about `BluePrints` and the so called
`UObject-System` we recommend you the concept pages for
xref:beginners_guide/Concepts/BluePrints.adoc[BluePrints] and the
xref:beginners_guide/Concepts/UObject.adoc[UObject-System].
