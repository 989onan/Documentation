= MainWindow

The main window contains most important settings and docks for the
primary editor features.

== Menu-Bar

Every window has a menu bar, but the menu bar of the main window is a
little bit special because it also contains entries for global settings,
project settings and file management.

== Tab-Bar

image:UnrealEditor/TabBar.jpg[image]

Every window has a tab bar which can hold multiple views/windows. If the
main window/view get closed (as tab or the containing "real" window) the
project gets completely closed, also all other windows.

== Viewport

image:UnrealEditor/MainViewport.jpg[image]

The viewport is simply a preview of the map, where you can place and
manipulate a world. We don't have access to the Satisfactory map source files like Coffee Stain does,
so this viewport is more or less useless to us. Our work will take place mainly in other windows.

== Tool-Bar

The tool-bar is a strongly simplified version of the menubar and is icon
base, but its the only place where you can find the access to the
`+Alpakit+` window. The Tool-bar contains mainly shortcuts for the
project settings, c++ building and source control, the remaining features are mostly
not useful without a map as mentioned above in the Viewport section.

== Outliner

The outliner is here again pretty useless because it contains the
list of placed objects in the world, and again, we don't have the map files.

== Modes

One more useless view cause we don't have a proper map to edit, but this
would help you to place things into the world and contains a list of
basic actors and edit tools for brushes, terrain and so on.

== Content-Browser

Finally a very very useful and important view. This view is simply a
file browser for all contents of your mod project and SF/UE source like
C++ classes, models and textures, etc.

In the left half, you can see a tree structure based folder explorer
where you can select a folder which contents get the displayed on the
right-hand side half of the view.

It also has in the left upper corner or in the context menu
(r-click-menu) the ability to create, import, export, delete or modify
content.

You can find in the `Content`-Root folder all "normal" assets and the
`C++-Classes` root folder contains all c++ classes.
