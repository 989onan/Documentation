= Mod-Init

Our mod must has a starting point from which everything else gets invoked. If we don't have one, then the mod's content will never be added to the game during loading.
In our case this the `InitMod`-Actor from SPL. That dude will implement events which get in the world-bootup called.

== Initial Mod Setup

To keep your folder structure organized, let's create a folder where all
of your mod content will go. This folder will have the name of your mod as the name, and for this tutorial, we'll use the name "DocMod" as an example.

Create a folder, for example,`+Content/DocMod+`, to serve as
your mod-project-root. All of the assets for our mod will go in this
folder and will be turned into a pak when we're done.

== Create the Actor

First of all, we need to create the proper path for the actor. The path for the actor will
depend on the mod name, specifically on the name of the pak we will
provide to the end user. Our mod name will be `+DocMod+` and the pak file name will be
`DocMod_p.pak`, so we need to create a folder in the UE asset
root with that name. So we create the folder `Content/DocMod`, and within it a new Actor called `InitMod` of type `SMLInitMod`.
