= Mod-Init

Like everything, a mod has a start where everything else gets invoked.
In our case this the InitMod-Actor from SPL. That dude will implement
events which get in the world-bootup called.

== Create the Actor

First of all, we need to create the proper path for the actor. That one
depends on the mod name, specifically on the name of the pak we will
provide. Our mod name will be `+Doc Mod+` and the pak file name will be
`DocMod_p.pak` that means we need to create a folder in the UE asset
root with our name. So we create the folder
`Content/DocMod`. And finally in there you now just need to add a new Actor called `InitMod` of type `SMLInitMod`.

Done, now you will be able to register recipes and other stuff in here.
