= First Simple Machine

In this chapter we'll create a simple machine which simply counts the
items and types of items that pass through it, outputting them again on
the other side.

== Create the machine

Creating a simple machine is fairly straightforward. First of all,
you'll need to create again a xref:beginners_guide/simpleMod/buildable.adoc[buildable]
with descriptor and recipe, but this time use f.e.
`+this <Mesh_SimpleMachine.fbx>+` as the mesh and
`+this <Icon_SimpleMachine.png>+` as icon.

Now we simply want to add the
xref:beginners_guide/Concepts/FactoryConnectors.adoc[factory-connectors]
(conveyor input and output). For that add two new components of type
`+FGFactoryConnectionSim+` to the actor and place them in the lower
center of the input/output connection points of the mesh, don't forget
to rotate them (currently we dont realy have any reference how you can
see in wich direction the connection points to).

Set the output's direction to output and the type to Item. The inputs
type also needs to get set to Item but the direction needs to be input.

We also want to make our machine depend on electricity. For that we need
to add a xref:beginners_guide/Concepts/PowerNetwork.adoc[FGPowerConnectionComponent]
at the position of the power connection point of the mesh. Set
`+M Max Num Connections+` to something like 1.

== Init logic

The init logic happens in the `+BeginPlay+` event and initializes the
base state of the factory (also based on the save information) There is
not that much we need to do here. The only thing we need to do is to set
the PowerInfo of the power connector to your added
`+FGPowerInfoComponent+` and we need to set the target consumption of
the power-info to something like 1.0.

== Grab logic

The grab function of the `+FGBuildable+` gets executed by the output
connector when a new item gets requested. To add logic to it, we simply
need to override it.

Because we want to store the count of items transferred and the count of
different item-types, we will need to add a new global integer variable,
let's call it "itemAmount" and and a array of `+FGItem+`-Classes, call
it "itemTypes".

Now, in the grab logic, first we check if the machine has power. We do
this by using the "HasPower"-node of the `+FGPowerInfoComponent+`. If it
returns false, we return nothing and the boolean is false.

But if it's true, we use the grab function of the input connector to
request a new item.

If the boolean is true, we increase the "itemAmount" integer by one and
add the item unique to the "itemTypes". Now we simply log "itemAmount"
and the size of the "itemTypes"-array. After that we return the item we
got from the grab and true.

If the boolean is false, we just return nothing (the boolean needs to be
false).

That's it, try out your newly created machine!
