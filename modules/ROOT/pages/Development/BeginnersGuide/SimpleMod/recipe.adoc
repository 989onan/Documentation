= Recipe vs Schematic

'Recipes' are used to define the item input/cost and output of crafting
items, buildables, etc. Recipes are not only used for the craft bench or
the workshop, but also for the build gun, smelters, manufacturers and
more.

[TIP]
====
Note that recipes are used to define both crafting recipes in the craft
bench and machines _and_ construction prices when using the build gun.
All buildables actually have an item equivalent in game as well.
====

'Schematics' define
https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Milestones[Milestones], the shipments
submitted to FICSIT via the HUB in order to unlock new recipes and
features.

== Initial Mod Setup

To keep your folder structure organized, let's create a folder where all
of your mod content will go.

Create a folder, for example,`+Content/DocMod+`, to serve as
your mod-project-root. All of the assets for our mod will go in this
folder and will be turned into a pak when we're done.

== Create a Recipe

First of all, we want to add a recipe to the game which will get
unlocked with the schematic we will create afterwards. Create a folder,
`+Content/DocMod/Recipes+` which will contain all our recipes.

Now, back in Unreal, we can create a new BP Class in this folder which
extends xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Crafting.adoc#_recipes_fgrecipe[FGRecipe] to serve as our recipe.

Finally, we can define the recipe description itself. Open up the class
and go to the class defaults and set the properties to the values you
want.

* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  If you want to define a name for your recipe, check this and type the
  name in. For our tutorial recipe, we'll check it and call it "Doc
  Recipe"
* {blank}
+
M Ingredients::
  This is an array of structs, each of which contains the information of one crafting component.
  Together, the array forms the input items for the recipe.
  For this example, we'll add one entry and set `Desc_Leaves` as the `Item Class` and 42 as the `Amount`.
* {blank}
+
M Manufacturing Duration::
  This determines the time it takes for a machine to process this recipe.
  We'll keep it at 1 for now, cuz we are super speedy pioneers.
* {blank}
+
M Manual Manufacturing Multiplier::
  If you want to use the same recipe for machines and the craft bench,
  with this value you can define how much longer the crafting of this recipe should take longer int the craft bench.
  Cuz we don't have time, we set this to 0 or 1 wich is the default value.
* {blank}
+
M Produced In::
  Here we need to select the machine that can use the recipe,
  for example, `+FGWorkBench+`.
* {blank}
+
M Product::
  This is again an array of structs containing information regarding the
  item types and amounts that form the output of the recipe.
  In our case we'll add an entry with `Desc_Wood` as the `+Item Class+`
  and 1 as the `Amount`

[WARNING]
====
Note that although recipes with more than out output item type will
still compile and load properly, they will crash the game if you try to
use them, even if you were to make a modded machine with more than one
output to craft it in. If you'd like to make a recipe with more than one
output, ask for help with this on the discord, as the only way to do
this right now is a bit roundabout until Coffee Stain makes such recipes
not crash the game.
====

Ok, now you've created your first recipe! Next, let's add it to a
schematic to make it available ingame.

== Create a Schematic

Schematics are what Satisfactory uses to grant additional recipes and
capabilities to the player. Schematics are the 'package' groupings
you'll see in the HUB that have rewards associated with them. You'll
note that even though alternate recipes are researched at the MAM, you
still need to submit items at the HUB to unlock the milestone associated
with them. Schematics are also used for the Tier 0 tutorial phases. To
get started, create a folder in your main mod folder for your
schematics, for example, `+Content/DocMod/Schematics+`.

Inside this folder create again a new BP Class but this time of type
xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Schematic.adoc[FGSchematic] and f.e. with the name "Schem_Doc". Open it and go again
to its defaults.

* {blank}
+
M Type::
  The type of the schematic, which determines if it's part of the
  tutorial system or if it's a Milestone or whatever.
  We'll use `Milestone`.
* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  The in-game name of our schematic exactly as it is displayed to the
  user, for example, "Doc Hub Upgrade".
* {blank}
+
M Schematic Category::
  Defines the category in which this schematic gets grouped into. Go
  ahead and pick one, it doesn't matter for our example.
* {blank}
+
M Sub Category::
  Defines in wich sub group the schematic should get categorized.
  We leave this array empty.
* {blank}
+
M Tech Tier::
  Determines which Tier the schematic will appear under in the HUB.
  We'll set it to 1 so that our content is available as soon as you
  finish the tutorial.
* {blank}
+
M Time to Complete::
  Remember that anyoing time whene you purchased a schematic
  and the space ship leaves you for a couple of minutes
  were you are simply not able to purchase any further schematics?
  This is exactly the value defining how long you will be annoyed.
  We will set it, to... let's say... 10.
M Schematic Icon::
  The icon displayed on the schematic in the HUB.
  We can use link:Icon_SchemDoc.png[this example image].
* {blank}
+
M Depends on Schematic::
  Setting this option will require the selected schematic to be
  activated first before this one can be activated. We'll leave this
  empty because we don't want our content to require any other particular
  schematic to be unlocked first.
* {blank}
+
M Additional Schematic Dependencies::
  Similar to `+M Depends on Schematic+`. Additional schematics to be
  dependent on can be listed here.
* {blank}
+
M Cost::
  A list of item amounts which are needed to activate the schematic in
  the HUB. We'll add two entries, one with 100 `+Desc_Leaves+` and
  another one with 100 `+FGWood+`
* {blank}
+
M Unlocks::
  This array contains finally the rewards the player will get when unlocking this schematic.
  It is a array of xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Schematic.adoc#_fgunlock_ufgunlock[FGUnlock]s.
  There are many different kinds of unlocks we discuss in the schematics page
  but what we add to this array is a `BP Unlock Recipe` were we can then add
  recipes like our newely created one to the array it added.
* {blank}
+
M Include In Builds::
  Set this to 'public builds' so that your content is included in the
  build. Presumably, this is what Coffee Stain uses to keep their
  developer milestones made for testing from being shipping with the
  main game.

Finally! What a class. Now we just need to register this schematic in
the runtime.

== Register the Schematic
  To register the schematic we can use the newly created InitMod
  and add the schematics to the `M Schematics` array of the InitMod.
  Just go to the defaults page and add it there, they you're good to go.

And we're set! Our recipe and schematic are registered and should
show up in the game now.
