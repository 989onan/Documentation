= Init Game World

Our mod must have a starting point from which everything else gets invoked.
If we don't have one, then our mod's content will never be added to the game during loading!
In our case this is the `InitGameWorld` Blueprint.

[NOTE]
====
If you're interested in how the content loading system works,
you can read more on the xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Mod Modules] system page.

== Initial Mod Setup

Since SML3.0, mods are now Unreal plugins,
and their loading is handled by Unreal itself.

First off, we'll need to create the Unreal Plugin for our mod.
You can do this by clicking
`Edit` -> `Plugins` -> `New Plugin` -> `Blank Plugin` in the Unreal Editor.

The name of your plugin _must_ be your mod's
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc#_mod_reference[Mod Reference].
For this documentation example, you can use `DocMod` as the mod reference.
When you start on your own mod, you will have to create a new plugin
with a mod reference other than this.

You can fill out the Descriptor Data, or leave it blank, as we can edit that later.

Leave "Show Content Directory" checked and press `Create Plugin`.

This should have created a plugin workspace folder under `<project>/Plugins/<Mod Reference>`.

[TIP]
====
If you consider to Open Source your mod. Or simply want to use a version control system like Git,
this folder would be ideal for you to create the repository.

That would mean, if you work on multiple mods,
you only need one full project setup and for each Mod you have your own plugin folder and repository.
====

Your new plugin should now appear at the bottom of the plugins list in the Project > Other category. You might have to scroll a bit to find it.

Next, click `Edit...` to edit more of your mod's plugin settings.

Here, you can fill out some additional details for your mod.
Since we're working on an example mod right now,
most of these fields are not relevant to us.
You should be sure to set `Category` to `Modding`
and `Version` to `1.0.0`,
which sorts your mod to appear with other mods
in the Modding section of the Plugins list.

These fields will be explained further when you prepare to upload your mod for others to use.

== Create the Class

It's time to create the InitGameWorld blueprint for our mod!

You might need to click on `View Options` -> `Show Plugins Content`
in a Content Browser to view the contents of your mod.

You can find your mod in the `<Your Mod Reference> Content`
subfolder of the Content Browser root folder.

This folder is where you will be putting most of the assets (models, blueprints, textures, etc.) that your mod uses.

[WARNING]
====
Be sure to read the notes on
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc#_mod_reference[Mod References]
if you have not yet done so.
It is critical that your mod reference follows these format rules.
====

Now we need to create our `InitGameWorld` Blueprint so that SML can load our mod's content into the game.

Within your mod's content folder,
right click and select `Blueprint Class` under `Create Basic Asset`.
Click the triangle to close the Common Classes section,
and click the other triangle to expand the All Classes section.
Start typing `GameWorldModule` into the search box.
Once it comes up, select it and press the green Select button to create the blueprint.
Name it `InitGameWorld`.

You will be able to register recipes and other content from this module.

Next, double click on the module to open up its blueprint settings.

To make sure that SML automatically detects and loads our InitGameWorld,
we must be sure to mark that it is the Root Module.

Otherwise, let's get on to creating our first modded content - a custom recipe!
