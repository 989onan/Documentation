= Plugin Setup and Game World Module

To get started with our mod, we'll need to make a new Unreal plugin.
Every mod you make should be a separate Unreal plugin.

== Unreal Plugin Creation

Since SML3.0, mods are now Unreal plugins,
and their loading is handled by Unreal itself.

First off, we'll need to create the Unreal Plugin for our mod.
You can do this by clicking
`Edit` -> `Plugins` -> `New Plugin` -> `Content Only Plugin` in the Unreal Editor.

The name of your plugin _must_ be your mod's
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc#_mod_reference[Mod Reference].
For this documentation example, you can use `DocMod` as the mod reference.
When you start on your own mod, you will have to create a new plugin
with a mod reference other than this.

[WARNING]
====
Be sure to read the notes on
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc#_mod_reference[Mod References]
if you have not yet done so.
It is critical that your mod reference follows these format rules.
====

You can fill out the Descriptor Data, or leave it blank, as we can edit that later.

Leave "Show Content Directory" checked and press `Create Plugin`.

Your new plugin should now appear at the bottom of the plugins list
in the Project > Other category. Hooray!
You might have to scroll a bit to find it.

Next, click `Edit...` to edit more of your mod's plugin settings.

Here, you can fill out some additional details for your mod.
Since we're working on an example mod right now,
most of these fields are not relevant to us.
You should be sure to set `Category` to `Modding`
and `Version` to `1.0.0`,
which sorts your mod to appear with other mods
in the Modding section of the Plugins list.

Note that if you give your mod an icon image here, you'll have to follow
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/Adding_Ingame_Mod_Icon.adoc[a few extra steps]
for it to show up in game.

These fields will be explained further when you prepare to upload your mod for others to use.

Creating your plugin will create a plugin workspace folder under `<project>/Plugins/<Mod Reference>`.

You might need to click on `View Options` -> `Show Plugins Content`
in a Content Browser to view the contents of your mod in the Unreal Editor.
image:BeginnersGuide/simpleMod/ShowPluginContentInViewer.png[Show Plugin Content in Viewer]

You can find your mod in the `<Your Mod Reference> Content`
subfolder of the Content Browser root folder.

This folder is where you will be putting most of the assets
(models, blueprints, textures, etc.) that your mod uses.

[TIP]
====
If you want to Open Source your mod,
or simply want to use a version control system like Git,
the mod's plugin folder (containing the `.uplugin file`)
is the ideal place for you to create the repository.

Using version control is essential for collaborating on a mod with others,
it helps write patch notes when you release an update,
and you can use it to go back to previous versions of your files if something breaks.

If you work on multiple mods,
you only need one full project setup
(which can be the cloned SatisfactoryModLoader repository)
and each mod that you make will be a plugin in this project setup.
The plugin's folder would be the version control repository for that mod.
====

[TIP]
====
If, for some reason, you want the editor or game to not load your plugin,
simply change the extension of your uplugin file to `.disabled`,
meaning Unreal Engine will not be able to tell the directory represents a plugin.

This is helpful when xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[updating your mods] later.

If your uplugin file was previously `ExampleMod.uplugin`,
change it to `ExampleMod.uplugin.disabled`
====

== Create Game World Module

Now that we've created our plugin,
we must create a starting point from which everything else gets invoked.
If we don't have one, then our mod's content will never be added to the game during loading!
In our case, the starting point will be a Game World Module.

[NOTE]
====
If you're interested learning about the other types of Modules
and how the content loading system works,
you can read more on the
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Mod Modules] system page.
====

Within your mod's content folder,
right click and select `Blueprint Class` under `Create Basic Asset`.
Click the triangle to close the Common Classes section,
and click the other triangle to expand the All Classes section.
Start typing `GameWorldModule` into the search box.
Once it comes up, select it and press the green Select button to create the blueprint.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure that you select `GameWorldModule` as the asset's parent class,
and not the game world module of another mod (or SML's)!
====

Name it `InitWorld_YourModReferenceHere`.
By giving it a name that includes the mod reference,
it becomes easier to identify in crash logs
and helps you tell the modules of different mods apart in the editor.

You will be able to register recipes and other content using this module.

Next, double click on the module to open up its blueprint settings.

To make sure that SML automatically detects and loads our module,
we must be sure to mark that it is the Root Module.

If you'd like to learn more about root modules, you can read about it on the
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc[Mod Modules] system page.
Otherwise, let's get on to creating our first modded content - a custom recipe!

== Next Steps

We could build and test our mod right now,
but it wouldn't do very much, outside of increase the loaded mod count on the main menu.

Next up, let's get started making our own content by creating a recipe and a schematic.
