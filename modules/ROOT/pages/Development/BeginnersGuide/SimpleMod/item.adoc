= Create an Item

Now that you've created a custom recipe and schematic, you'll want to create a custom Item. For this tutorial, we'll make an item named 'Doc Item'.

== Creating the BP-Class

The item system is a bit complex, but to summarize it, we simply need to describe our item in a xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Inventory.adoc#_item_descriptor_afgitemdescriptor[FGItemDescriptor] class.
To create it, go to the content browser in the Unreal editor. Go to the Mod-Root `+Content/DocMod/` and create a new folder and call it "Items" to keep with our organization pattern so far.
Then create a new Blueprint of type `FGItemDescriptor` in the folder. We'll call it `+Desc_DocItem+` to follow Coffee Stain's naming convention ("Desc" stands for descriptor).

== Describe the Item

Open the class and you should see the default settings of the classes' attributes. If not, just click on "Default Settings" and they should appear in the settings browser of the class editor. In here you will find multiple attributes with the different properties such an Item can have.

* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  The item's name in game.
  We'll set this to "Doc Item".
* {blank}
+
M Description::
  Set this to a simple description of the item.
  In our case, we use the text "This is the starter Item of the Doc mod."
* {blank}
+
M Abbreviated Display Name::
  Set this to a shorter display name if needed.
  In our case, we use the same text as the Display Name, "Doc Item"
* {blank}
+
M Stack Size::
  Satisfactory has hardcoded item stack sizes. Items can stack to either 1 (One), 50 (Small), 100 (Medium), 200 (Big), 500 (Huge), or 50,000 (Fluid).
  Go ahead and pick one as you see fit.
* {blank}
+
M Can be Discarded::
  Whether it can be trashed using the trashcan icon on your inventory. AWESOME sink settings are handled elsewhere.
  We'll uncheck it so that you can't throw the item into the trashcan. Ficsit does not waste.
* {blank}
+
M Remember Pick Up::
  Something having to do with dropped items.
  Check this box to change the behavior of dropped items.
* {blank}
+
M Energy Value::
  This value describes how much energy this item should release if it gets burned in a generator. 
  Our Doc Item won't be a fuel item, so it shouldn't be able to get burned in any generators, so we'll use 0.0 for that value.
* {blank}
+
M Radioactive Decay::
  If set to a value greater than 0, the item will cause the player to take radiation damage. Values should not be greater than 1.
  We'll leave this at 0 for ease of testing our mod.
* {blank}
+
M Form::
  This describes the type of this item: Invalid, Solid, Liquid, Gas, or Heat
  The new item will be treated as a Solid.
* {blank}
+
M Conveyor Mesh::
  As we know, all items have 3-Dimensional representations for when they're dropped on the ground or on a conveyor belt.
  Items use the mesh you specify here when you've dropped them on the ground and for display on conveyors.
  We'll cover this fully further down on the page, as setting it up to render correctly takes a couple of extra steps.
* {blank}
+
M Color 1::
  As this item is not a Liquid or Gas, we don't need to change this property.
* {blank}
+
M Color 2::
  As this item is not a Gas, we don't need to change this property.
* {blank}
+
M Compatible Item Descriptors::
  For some types of items, this is used to group items into sets of compatible items.
  Our Doc Item does not fall into any of these groups, so you don't need to add any descriptors to this list.
* {blank}
+
M Small Icon::
  This is a simple texture image of the object used in the inventory to visualize what the given stack is.
  The recommend size is 64px for regular items, 256px for buildgun items.
  We have an image ready for use link:{attachmentsdir}/BeginnersGuide/simpleMod/Icon_DocItem.png[here]. When using your own models, you can follow the tutorial xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/generating_icons.adoc[here] to generate icons that look like the ones in game.
* {blank}
+
M Big Icon::
  This is the same as the small icon but can be higher resolution.
  The recommend size is 256px for regular items, 512px for buildgun items.
  Let's just use the same icon file as before for simplicity.
* {blank}
+
M Category::
  This set of properties groups the item into a category, this affects where it shows up in the recipe list.
  We don't need this so we leave it on "None", resulting in the item being categorized under "Other" ingame.

== Item Visuals In World

In order to avoid having your item display as the default flat white cube
when on a conveyor or when dropped in the world, you must specify a Conveyor Mesh. 
We have an example model and textures you can use
link:{attachmentsdir}/BeginnersGuide/simpleMod/DocItem.zip[here].
We'll put them in a Folder together somewhere within your plugin folder, but first!
Importing a mesh and textures has a couple extra things we need to pay attention to.

Import just the Mesh, and pay attention on the dialog that pops up.
We should make sure that it does not create a material, because we want to use https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Rendering/Materials/MaterialInstances/index.html[material instances].
Uncheck the parameter pictured below and instead create a material instance of MM_FactoryBaked and set it on the mesh.
Keep it open once made because next we'll need to do the textures it needs.

Now import the 3 textures, we need to make sure Unreal handles our textures properly.
Open the imported Item_MREO texture, and set sRGB to off.
We have to do this because the texture contains special data in each channel, not a normal colour.
The xref:Development/Modeling/MainMaterials.adoc[Main Materials] page has more details about what's going on.

Now just feed the textures into the material instance we made. This is pretty standard to the way unreal does things so if you're a little confused standard Unreal tutorials will help! But we also have very specific settings on our material because of the way the asset was made. Whoever is making your assets will tell you what to do, if they don't know what anything means after reading about the main materials then come join us on Discord. For now just follow this image.

[TIP]
====
If you don't want to make a custom mesh for items you create in the future, consider
xref:Development/ReuseGameFiles.adoc[reusing the mesh]
of a nondescript base game item, such as the
https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/HUB_Parts[HUB Parts],
as opposed to leaving it as the default white cube.

== Make the Item Available

The item is available to the user when it gets loaded at least once.
Because Unreal loads assets with a just in time method,
we somehow need to force the asset to be loaded.
One way we can do that is by having our item used in a Recipe. 
Conveniently, we're already planning to have the item be usable in a recipe so that the player can obtain it.
Change the outcome of our already created recipe to this new item,
or create a new recipe for it if you'd like to practice that.

And you're done! Go ahead and Alpakit and check out your fancy new item in game.
