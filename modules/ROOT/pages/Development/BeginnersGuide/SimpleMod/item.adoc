= Create an item

Now that you created a custom recipe and schematic, you might want to
create a custom Item. For this, we need an Idea what name the item
should have, how it should look like and stuff like that. We decided to
make a new ingot called 'Doc Ingot'.

== Creating the BP-Class

The item system is a bit special but overall we simply just need to
describe our item in a xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Inventory.adoc#_item_descriptor_afgitemdescriptor[FGItemDescriptor] class.
To create it go to the content browser in the unreal editor.
Go to the Mod-Root and create a new folder and call it f.e. "Items".
Then create a new BlueprintClass of type `FGItemDescriptor` in it.
Call it what ever you want, but we will call it `+Desc_DocItem+`
("Desc" stands for descriptor).

== Describe the Item

Now open the class and you should see the default settings of the
classes attributes. If not, just click on "Default Settings" and they
should appear in the settings browser of the class editor. In here you
will find multiple attributes with the different properties such an Item
can have.

* {blank}
+
M Use Display Name and Description::
  Because we have just a simple Item we need to check this (set the
  boolean to true) so that the item name and description are used
  directly of this class.
* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  Set this to "Doc Item" so that the item gets called like that ingame.
* {blank}
+
M Description::
  This should get set to a simple description of the item. In our case,
  we use the text "This is the starter Item of the SFM-Doc."
* {blank}
+
M Stack Size::
  Set this to f.e. Big, this is just a simple description of how big you
  should be able to stack this item.
* {blank}
+
M Can get Discarded::
  Uncheck it so that you can't throw the item into the trashcan
  because FicsIt does not waste.
* {blank}
+
M Energy Value::
  Our item is not organic, so it shouldn't be able to get burned in any
  generator. This value describes how much energy this item should
  release if it gets burned in a generator. And so we use 0.0 for that
  value.
* {blank}
+
M Radioactive Decay::
  I don't think that your Item is so exciting that it should emit
  radioactivity, so we set this value to 0.0 because it describes how
  radioactive this item should be.
* {blank}
+
M Conveyor Mesh::
  As we know, an item is 3-Dimensional so we need a 3D-model for the
  item how it should look if it gets transported on a conveyor belt. We
  have an example model link:{attachmentsdir}/BeginnersGuide/simpleMod/Mesh_DocItem.fbx[here].
  Make sure that you check both "Used with Spline Meshes" and "Used
  with Instanced Static Meshes" for each of the model's materials or
  the textures won't appear in the game.
* {blank}
+
M Item Category::
  This groups the item into a category, we don't need this so we leave
  it on "None" and so the item gets categorized under "Other".
* {blank}
+
M Small Icon::
  This is a simple texture image of the object used f.e. in the
  inventory to visualize what the given stack is. We have an image ready
  for use link:{attachmentsdir}/BeginnersGuide/simpleMod/Icon_DocItem.png[here].
* {blank}
+
M Big Icon::
  This is the same as the small icon but, bigger.

== Make the item available

The item is available to the user when it gets loaded at least once.
Because of Unreal loads assets just in time, we somehow need to force
the asset to get loaded. And we can simply do that when our item gets
used in a Recipe and this also allows the user to somehow get the item.
So just change the outcome of our already created recipe to this
item. And you're done.
