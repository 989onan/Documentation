= Setting Up Incredibuild

Satisfactory is a very big game.
As such, it can take an enormous amount of time to compile all of the source code, even on high end hardware.
In this section, we will guide you through the process of setting up Incredibuild,
which is a build acceleration tool for Microsoft Visual Studio and Jetbrains Rider.
It can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to compile the project,
which is especially helpful if you're doing a lot of C++ modding.

== Applying for a license

Before we can install Incredibuild, we need to get a license.
Now don't worry, it's completely free for up to 2 developers per license.
All you need to do is visit the https://www.incredibuild.com/pricing[Incredibuild Website] and click on the "Free Forever" plan.
Just fill out the application with your details (You can use your name for the "Company Name" field since you only need a personal license) and submit it.
Within a few minutes you should receive an email in your inbox containing a link to download Incredibuild and a license activation code that looks something like this:

== Installing Incredibuild

Now that we have our license, we can begin installing Incredibuild.
If you haven't already, you can download the agent from https://dl.incredibuild.com/ib10-latest[here].
Run the installer and read the license agreement before accepting, and then select "Grid" for the agent configuration.
This will allow you to initiate builds from your machine and to distribute the load across any other machines you choose to install the agent on.

Next, you will need to enter the license key you received earlier.
Choose which directory to install the agent to and make sure to select "Install the Incredibuild add-in for MS Visual Studio IDE" if you are using Visual Studio.

Finally, you have the option to use SSL to encrypt communication between your agents, but this is only necessary if you are distributing across multiple machines
or exposing your coordinator web interface to the internet.
For this tutorial, we won't need SSL so we will select "Do not use a trusted certificate".
Now all you need to do is choose a username and password to log in to the coordinator interface and install the agent.
When the agent is done installing, you can move on to the next step.

== Post-Install

Now that you have installed Incredibuild, you are ready to begin accelerating your project compilations!
Whenever you initiate a build in Visual Studio, Rider, or Unreal Engine, they will automatically delegate the job to your Incredibuild agent(s).
With Incredibuild, you should see a significant reduction in compile times across all projects.
Some of our modders even saw a 90% reduction in time to compile the FactoryGame solution for both development and shipping!

[TIP]
====
You can monitor the progress of your build more closely by right-clicking the system tray icon for Incredibuild and selecting "Build Monitor"
