= Adding In-game Mod Icon


When checking the mod list ingame we would find something like this associated with our mod:

If that's the case it probably means we didn't setup a proper icon for our Mod as it doesn't automatically gets included with Alpakit.

== Setup

First we need a png file that we'll be using as an Icon for our mod.

Let's navigate to our SML project (where the FactoryGame.uproject file is located) and from there go to /Plugins/<mod_reference> where <mod_reference> it's the reference name we gave to our mod. We should now be in the folder where our .uplugin file is located.

Now let's create 2 folders:

- Config
- Resources

[WARNING]
====
Be sure that the folder name are as shown above

Our folder should now look like this

In our "Resources" folder we will put our Icon and rename it as "Icon128.png". This name is necessary to have have it recognized.

Now we need to tell Alpakit to include our "Resources" folder in the mod when paking it. To do this, inside the "Config" folder, we need to create a text file inside of which we'll insert this script

[source,text]
----
[StageSettings]
+AdditionalNonUSFDirectories=Resources
----

the attribute "+AdditionalNonUSFDirectories" tells Alpakit that we wish to include a directory during the paking our mod.

We pass it the "Resources" value which is the folder we wish to include (the one containing our Mod Icon).

Save the text file we created, renaming it as "PluginSettings" and change its extension to .ini

== Conclusions

Now you can Alpakit your mod again and the icon should be visible in the Mod List
