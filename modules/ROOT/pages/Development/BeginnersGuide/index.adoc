= Getting Started

In this section, we will guide you through the process making your first
mod for Satisfactory and provide important information regarding modding.

== Mod Reference

When need to talk about the `mod reference` first befor we continue,
because we will use it more often.

The mod reference is more strictly typed version of your mod name basically.
This mod reference will then be used in class names, file names, folder names and other places.

Basically the mod reference is your mod name in caml-case
and not containing any special characters like (` `, `+`, `#`, `.`, `ÃŸ`, ...).

Example:
Mod Name: `Example Mod`
Mod Reference: `ExampleMod`

We would reccomend to begin with a uper-case latter so it fits better into a combination of multiple strings (f.e. `FExampleModModule`)
