= Project-Setup

A key aspect of fast and efficient development is a proper Workspace and
project setup. With a misconfigured or suboptimal setup, you'll lose
valuable time. That's why we will guide you now through making a good
project setup for Satisfactory.

[TIP]
====
If you'd prefer a different format of guide, you can find a video guide https://youtu.be/-HVw6-3Awqs?t=249[here].
**As of SML 3.0.0, these tutorials are partially out of date, but some of the concepts will still carry over.**
If you get stuck in the video tutorials, return here and follow these guides instead.
Be sure to read over the steps here as well to be sure you're doing things correctly.
====

== Starter Project

You should have already downloaded the starter project in the previous steps of the tutorial. Unzip `SML-Shipping-Dev-Win64.zip` to get the starter project files. If you're having issues extracting the zip, try using another zip extracting software such as 7zip or WinRAR.

This will be the folder that all of your mod's files will be put into, so extract the folder somewhere convenient for you where you can find it later, such as your Documents folder. Of note - keep the directory as short as possible.
When packing Unreal projects, some filenames can get long,
so a very nested location may cause issues.

You should strongly consider using version control software
such as Git, to manage your mod's files,
but doing so is outside the scope of this tutorial.
If you choose to do this, the plugin folder that you create later
will serve as your repo folder.
You may wish to clone the starer project repo as opposed to using the downloaded zip.

You can use this starer project for developing multiple mods,
since each mod will be its own separate plugin folder within this project.

Feel free to name the extracted `SML-Shipping-Dev-Win64` folder to whatever you like.

== Setting up Wwise

Wwise is an audio and sound system used by Satisfactory, and setting it up is required to get your modding environment working. Setting up Wwise
can be difficult, but we'll walk through the steps here. Be sure to follow only the steps listed here - Wwise will often present you with lots of additional messages 
that looks like errors or warnings but can be safely ignored.

[WARNING]
====
If part of the setup process fails for you, it is most likely this step. If you have errors completing the setup process, come back to here and make sure you followed these steps correctly.
====

Start the Wwise launcher that you installed earlier and update the launcher if needed.
Next, open the `UNREAL ENGINE` tab in the upper tab-bar.
Make sure you have signed in to the launcher. 
It can give ambiguous error messages when trying to integrate Wwise if you aren't signed in.
Do _not_ click any of the update buttons on the Unreal Engine Wwise tab.
Satisfactory requires a specific version of Wwise to work,
and updating can prevent your mod from working correctly.
Click on the three lines next to the "RECENT UNREAL ENGINE PROJECTS" label
and click `Browse for project...`.
Now select the `FactoryGame.uproject` file in your mod's project folder.
Your project should now appear in the Wwise launcher.
Click on the `Integrate Wwise into Project...` button.

You'll have to again select version `2021.1.0.7575`
(you might need to change the left dropdown to `All` to do this). 

If version `2021.1.0.7575` does not appear even after you have selected `All`,
edit your `.uproject` file in a text editor to be sure that `EngineAssociation`
is set to `4.25.3-CSS`.

If Wwise tells you that you need to modify your installation in a yellow warning box, go ahead and follow what it says for this step. If Wwise warns you that it could not find an installation in a red warning box, be sure that you have selected the correct version as stated above. If you see a blue box offering both "Modify" and "Add Plug-in", do nothing and continue to the next step.

Under "Wwise Project Path", click the little triangle dropdown on the right and choose `New` to clear the path.

If everything worked according to plan, you should now be able to click on the blue `Integrate` button. Do so, and agree to the terms to start the process.

That's it! If Wwise shows "Operation completed successfully," you have integrated Wwise into your project.

The below gif is slightly outdated - be sure to choose version `2021.1.0.7575`.

== Generate Visual Studio Files

Next, you'll need to generate the remaining files for the project with Unreal Engine's "Generate Visual Studio Project Files" tool. 

To do this, you'll need to run a command, unless you already have another version of Unreal Engine installed. If you do, right-click on the `.uproject` file and select `Generate Visual Studio project files`.  Go ahead and skip down to the xref:#_project_compilation[next section] if this works for you.

Otherwise, you'll need to run a tool from the command line to generate the project files. The command will follow the form below:

```
"<path to your Unreal build tool here (it installed with the custom editor)>" -projectfiles -project="<path to your .uproject file here>" -game -rocket -progress
```

Here is an example of a complete command.

```
"C:\Program Files\Unreal Engine - CSS\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool.exe" -projectfiles -project="C:\Users\Rob\Documents\SMLExampleMod\FactoryGame.uproject" -game -rocket -progress
```

[WARNING]
====
The above command will not work if you copy paste it - you'll need to modify it yourself to point towards your project file and Unreal Engine install.
====

[WARNING]
====
Make sure you run the above command from Command Prompt and not Powershell. It is not correctly formatted for Powershell.
====

== Project Compilation

You'll want to compile the project now to ensure it generates correctly.

Do this by opening the .sln file, make sure you have in the toolbar `Development Editor` and `Win64` selected.
On the right side in solution explorer just r-click the `FactoryGame` project and hit `Build`. This will take some time; go pet some lizard doggos as you wait.

This creates the binaries used by the Editor, allowing it to interact with the native SML code or native code written by you.

When you want to test the mod, make sure to build the project for `Shipping`.
Without doing so, the editor binaries won't be able to dynamic link with their dependencies,
and the game will crash.

== Open Unreal Editor

The Unreal Editor allows you to create new content for the game and helps build your mod.
It also heavily relies on the C++ project, so make sure you don't change stuff in there unless you know what you're doing.

In order to open the project in Unreal Engine, you'll have to open the editor. You can find it by searching for it in the Windows search bar (it should appear as Unreal Engine - CSS) or by navigating to where you installed it, which is probably something similar to `C:\Program Files\Unreal Engine - CSS\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe`

Once the Unreal Engine editor has launched,
open your project by navigating to `Projects` -> `Browse` (bottom right corner) and selecting the file `FactoryGame.uproject` in your mod folder.
Opening the project for the first time can take a considerable amount of time.

You might be told that some modules were "missing or built with a missing engine version"; press `Yes` and allow it to build. This will take some time, and will drastically increase the size of your mod folder - go find some more lizard doggos to pet.

If this step fails, you should go back to
xref:#_project_compilation[compile the editor from Visual Studio]
to find out why it's erroring and return here when finished with that step.
Consider seeking help on the Discord if you are stuck here.

Once you load into the editor,
you might see a popup that says 'New plugins are available.'
You can safely dismiss this popup.

Now is a good time to familiarize yourself with
the Unreal Engine editor through various other tutorials.
We suggest you take the 'Welcome to the Unreal Editor'
guided tutorial that the editor should be telling you about
if you haven't taken or dismissed it yet.

== Setting up Alpakit

Alpakit is a tool made by the modding community to make building and testing your mod more convenient.
Click on the Alpakit button in the Tool-Bar of the Unreal viewport. It looks like an alpaca peeking out of a cardboard box.

Click on the 3 dots near `Satisfactory Game Path`
and select your root Satisfactory game installation folder.
It will be something like
`C:\Program Files\EpicGames\SatisfactoryEarlyAccess\` 
Choose an item from `Launch Game After Packing`
if you'd like the game to be launched after you pack your mod files,
or leave it on 'Do not launch' if desired.
Check `Copy Mods to Game` so that you don't have to move files manually to test your mod.

Right now you should see two items in a searchable list -
`Example Mod (ExampleMod)` and `Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)`.
This is the list of all mods present in your project.
They are listed first by friendly name and then by
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc#_mod_reference[Mod Reference]
in parentheses.
Once you have created a mod, it will appear in the list automatically.
You can press the 'Alpakit!' button next to a mod to have Alpakit pack the files for you.

== Enable SML Developer Mode

You'll need to change one of the SML config settings to make SML load with your mod while you're developing it. 
Go to your Satisfactory install folder and edit `SML.cfg` within the `configs` folder. Set `developmentMode` to true, then save and close the file.
If you don't see this file yet, try running the game with SML installed first.

That should be it. Your mod project should now be set up and ready to go!
In the next sections, we'll run through a couple common modding examples
to demonstrate how to get started making a mod.

The Starter Project also includes and ExampleMod that you can look at,
which includes the examples described in this documentation,
as well as a few things that don't have pages yet.
Consider looking around in there after completing some of these tutorials.
