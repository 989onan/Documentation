# Creating a Git Repo for your Mod

TODO

If you're already experienced with Git, you can skip to the TODO section.

## Why Use a Git Repo

Advantages:

- Easily return to a past version of the code to test functionality
- Keep track of changes to write patch notes for a release
- Easily share your source code with others
- Backs up your files in case they get corrupted or you lose access to your computer
- Makes it harder to misplace your files if return to modding after an extended break
- Version control usage is an important skill that can benefit any coder.

Disadvantages:

- One more tool to learn

## Understanding Git

It is important to understand the distinction between "Git" and platforms like "GitHub" and "GitLab".

**Git** is open-source software created to manage files, usually text-based,
by keeping track of what changes between distinct 'revisions' of the files.
You can learn more about it https://git-scm.com/about[here].

Git is traditionally accessed via the command line, but there are many different tools that offer a more approachable and convenient interface to the same functionality.

**GitHub** are **GitLab** are web platforms that allow you to store a git "repository" online, called a "remote",
making it easy to collaborate with others, and providing a backup.

You should have already created an account on GitHub in order to obtain a copy of the custom engine version.

Git tools are used on your local computer to manage files.
The files are then "pushed" (uploaded) to a git remote hosted by a platform like GitHub.

You are, of course, free to check out the other tutorials, but they cover topics less relevant to Satisfactory modding.

## Beginner Git Users

You are free to use git from the command line, but it is recommended to use a GUI tool, as they are generally more approachable.

Consider the following software:

- https://desktop.github.com/[Github Desktop], free and great for beginners
- https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[Sourcetree], free but a bit more complicated than GitHub Desktop
- https://www.gitkraken.com/[GitKraken], free for non-commercial use as long as your code is public to the internet
- https://git-fork.com/[Fork], free evaluation copy

This tutorial will use GitHub Desktop, but all are valid choices.

Be extra careful with merge conflicts and branches in the context of Unreal Engine.

Most Unreal Engine asset files are raw binary files, which means git diffing them is difficult.
Panakotta has directions on using UE as diff tool

## Creating a Repository and Adding your Files

### Create the Remote Repository on GitHub

Read the information in this section, then follow the directions
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo[here].
You can stop once you get to the "Commit your first change" section.

You don't want to create your repository from a template.

Your repository name can be anything you want,
but it is highly recommended to use your
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc#_mod_reference[mod reference].

We suggest you leave your repository as 'Public' so others can learn from your mod, help you if you get stuck, and write extensions to your mod.

### Creating the Local Repository

In order to get started using Git, we need to create a local repository on our computer
to start tracking our existing plugin files.
There are a couple ways to do this.

### Option A: Clone the Remote Repository and Copy Your Files In

This approach skips the process of configuring the git remote settings,
but requires you to shuffle some files around.

Make sure you have the Unreal editor closed before proceeding.

Locate the folder for your mod in your Starter Project's plugins folder.
Temporarily rename it to something else, for example `YourModReference_Temp`.

Now, use your git client of choice to clone the remote repository you created on GitHub inside your plugins folder.

Directions for doing this in GitHub Desktop can be found
https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop[here].

Assuming your GitHub repository is named `YourModReference`,
you should now have a folder called `YourModReference` inside your plugins folder,
in addition to the `YourModReference_Temp` folder.

If your GitHub repository is named something other than your mod reference,
you should rename the folder to exactly match your mod reference.
This new folder will be your plugin's folder from now on, so it must obey the usual Mod Reference naming rules.

The `YourModReference` folder should be empty,
or, if you happen to have showing hidden files enabled on your system, you should see a `.git` folder.
If the folder contains has a readme or license file, delete them before proceeding unless you already know you want to keep them.

Now, move the contents of your plugin from the `YourModReference_Temp` folder into the `YourModReference` folder.

You have now successfully moved your plugin files into a git repository,
but they are not yet tracked. It's safe to delete the now-empty `YourModReference_Temp` folder.

Launch the editor and package your mod to make sure everything is still working.
If your plugin isn't appearing, make sure you got the folder names correct, and that there are no extra "layers" folder, the mod's folder (with the git repo)

### Option B: Create the Repository Locally and Push it to GitHub

This option will not be explained here, but exists as a heading since it is a valid approach.

If you chose this approach, look for other resources online to help you.
It will involve configuring your local repository to point to the remote on GitHub.

## Gitignore File

In order to keep temporary or user-specific files out of the repository,
git uses a file called `.gitignore` to keep track of what files to exclude.

If you created your mod with the Alpakit wizards, it will have already created this file for you.
If not, you can pick one up
https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/blob/master/Plugins/Alpakit/Templates/CPPAndBlueprintBlank/.gitignore[here].
