# Localizing your Mod

Satisfactory has been translated to multiple languages other than English,
and it's possible to implement this feature in your mods as well.

Before you can start writing translations,
or crowdsourcing them from your users,
you must make sure that the assets in your mod are set up to interact with Unreal Engine's localization system.

## Use The Right Kinds of Strings

In order to start localizing your mod, you need to make sure that text content is stored in the right format.

This means using FText and Format Text operations instead of FStrings and Appends.
In blueprints, you can tell you're working with FText when you see the triangle dropdown arrow 

You can read more about this on the
https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/Localization/Formatting/[Unreal documentation].

This documentation page will not talk about how to use Unreal's text formatting features, since the Unreal documentation already covers that well.

## Mark Fields as Localizable, or Not

In order to make sure that Unreal gathers text as localizable, it must be assigned a localization key.
In Blueprint assets, Unreal will do this for you automatically as long as it has been marked as such in the 'advanced settings' dropdown.

If a text field is not marked to be localized, it won't be gathered and exported for translation later on in the process.

A few Satisfactory asset types have fields that are notably not gathered for localization by default:

- Schematic Display Names
- Schematic Descriptions
- Item Display Names
- Item Descriptions
- Item Abbreviated Display Names
- Recipe Display Name (Overrides)
- Buildable Display Names
- Buildable Descriptions

As such, when adding your own values for these fields, you should be sure to mark the fields to be localized.

You may wish to intentionally exclude some fields from gathering.
Examples include placeholders in widgets that get replaced by bindings, since they'd only be visible in the editor preview for the widgets.

[NOTE]
====
Note that you can't (easily) localize textures or images, such as those used in UI.
As such, you should avoid embedding text inside of your UI graphics, as they can't be localized.
In widgets, consider using Canvas Panels, Overlays, and Render Transforms if you want to add stylized text to your widgets while still keeping it localized.

## Allow your Users to Contribute Translations

It is suggested that you use the Crowdin platform to allow your users to contribute translations for use in your mod.

This is the platform that Satisfactory itself uses to gather translations.
If you'd like to get involved, you can find information on how in the Welcome channel of the
https://discord.com/invite/satisfactory[official Satisfactory discord].

as well as some other community projects like
https://crowdin.com/project/satisfactory-calculator[Satisfactory Calculator]

Crowdin projects are free for open source projects, and you can apply

## Importing Translations from Crowdin to Unreal


## Compiling Localization Files

TODO engine changes being made to keep them in plugin dirs so shouldn't have to move via script

Compile in Unreal and run the Kyrium script or manually move to put them in your plugin's folder

## Plugin Settings

TODO seems to only listen to one Engine.ini, Mircea says there is a base UE field in plugins to specify localization directories, use that instead?

`YourModReference/Config/Engine.ini`

```ini
[Internationalization]
LocalizationPaths=../../../FactoryGame/Mods/YourModReference/Localization/YourModReference
```

In order to tell Unreal to package your localization files with your plugin,
you will need to add a line to your plugin's `YourModReference/Config/PluginSettings.ini`
to tell it to include both your Localization folder and your `Engine.ini` with the mod's files.

Config/PluginSettings.ini

```ini
[StageSettings]
+AdditionalNonUSFDirectories=Localization
+AdditionalNonUSFDirectories=Config
```

## Testing In-Game

Base game Satisfactory 'quick switch debug language' feature

Run the quick language switch command in the in-game Unreal console to see if the strings are loaded correctly.
