= Upgrading from SML 3.4.x to 3.5

== Why the change?

- Previously AlpaKit remapped mods to the Plugins folder behind the scenes. 
- Real™️ Official™️ mods will be in that folder instead of plugins, for when they eventually™️ come out
- This is just preparation for that well in advance

== What steps to take:

1. Move your mod folders from your `%SML_Project_Folder%\Plugins` to `%SML_Project_Folder%\Mods`.

SML 3.4.x SML\Plugins Locations:

SML 3.5.x SML\Mods Locations:

2. link:BeginnersGuide\project_setup.html#_project_compilation[Compile your project like normal.]

3. Congratulations! You are now up to date, and can continue modding as normal.
Just remember that mods go in the <SF_Install>\FactoryGame\Mods folder now!
