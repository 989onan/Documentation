= Setup

You should setup the project for BP modding first, like shown in the xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/project_setup.adoc[beginners guide].

== Basics

To build {cpp} unreal uses it's own written build pipline called "Unreal Build Tool" (aka. UBT).
UBT then does copying of files, running UHT and the build for the desired platform automatically when told to.
UHT is a tool called "Unreal Header Tool" which analyzes the source code you have written and replaces specific macros, like the `UFUNCTION`-Macro, with automatically generated code
and also generates seperate files containing even more additional automatically generated code.

You will run UBT for the "Development Editor"-Configuration automatically
when you try to open the `.uproject` file or when you f.e. run any build in the VS-Solution.

UBT uses multiple files placed into your source code for configuration of the source component you make.

`Targets` are UBTs "programs" you code.
Most of the time, like in our modding case, there are two `targets`.
One target is for compiling our `modules` compatible with the Unreal Editor,
another target is for compiling our `modules` compatible with the final game.
You can find the configuration files for them in the `/Source`-Folder of your project.
The target configuration are mostly named
like this `<ModuleName>.Target.cs` for the "shipping" configuration
and like this `<ModuleName>Editor.Target.cs` for the "development editor" configuration.

`Modules` are UBTs components of programs. Each target depends on at least one `module`.
A `module` can be librarys, the unreal engine it self, plugins, the headers of Satisfactory or your mod code.
Most `modules` are located in its own folder in the `/Source`-Folder of the project.
The Satisfactory headers we use to reference functions and data structures
are contained in the "FactoryGame" `module` located under `/Source/FactoryGame`.
Each `module` folder then has again a configuration file in its root folder.
For the "FactoryGame" `module` this will be the file `/Source/FactoryGame/FactoryGame.build.cs`.
In those configuration files you also define dependecies of the module like the unreal engien itself,
SF or thirdparty libraries you might want to include.

== Creating the Mod-Module

First you should navigate to the `/Source` folder of your project
and create a folder called just like your mod reference.
Then add a new file called `<your mod reference>.Build.cs`.
In it, you will need to add the configuration text.

Just use this example and replace all `<mod reference>` with your actual mod reference.
[source,c#]
----
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.IO;
using System;

public class <mod reference> : ModuleRules
{
    public <mod reference>(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
            "Core", "CoreUObject",
            "Engine",
            "InputCore",
            "OnlineSubsystem", "OnlineSubsystemUtils", "OnlineSubsystemNULL",
            "SignificanceManager",
            "PhysX", "APEX", "PhysXVehicles", "ApexDestruction",
            "AkAudio",
            "ReplicationGraph",
            "UMG",
            "AIModule",
            "NavigationSystem",
            "AssetRegistry",
            "GameplayTasks",
            "AnimGraphRuntime",
            "Slate", "SlateCore",
            "Json"
            });


        if (Target.Type == TargetRules.TargetType.Editor) {
			PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {"OnlineBlueprintSupport", "AnimGraph"});
		}
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {"FactoryGame", "SML"});

        bEnableExceptions = true;
        bUseRTTI = true;
    }
}
----

This configuration will add the basic unreal engine framework, Satisfactory and
the Mod Loader as dependencies to your module and it will also setup some other usefull stuff for you.

If you know what you do, you can also change some stuff.

Now you will need to add the module source code.

Do this by creating a file called `<your mod reference>Module.h` and fill it with this template.
Replace `<mod reference>` with your actual mod reference.
[source,cpp]
----
#pragma once

#include "Modules/ModuleManager.h"

class F<mod reference>Module : public FDefaultGameModuleImpl {
public:
	virtual void StartupModule() override;

	virtual bool IsGameModule() const override { return true; }
};
----

And we need a second file called `<your mod reference>Module.cpp` and fill that on with this template.
Again, replace `<mod reference>` with your actual mod reference.
[source,cpp]
----
#include "<mod reference>Module.h"

void F<mod reference>Module::StartupModule() {
	
}

IMPLEMENT_GAME_MODULE(<mod reference>Module, <mod reference>);
----

== Adding the Module to the Targets

Now that you created your module,
you will need to add it to the default targets so it actually gets built when you run UBT.

For that you will need to open the target configurations under `/Source/FactoryGame.Target.cs`
and `/Source/FactoryGameEditor.Target.cs` and do the following changes each.

Search for
[source,c#]
----
ExtraModuleNames.AddRange( new string[] { "FactoryGame", "SML", "ExampleMod" } );
----
(around line 15 and 11)
and add a string with your mod reference to the array literal like this:
[source,c#]
----
ExtraModuleNames.AddRange( new string[] { "FactoryGame", "SML", "ExampleMod", "ModReference" } );
----
(the mod reference used was `ModReference`, you need to change it to your own one)

== Finishing

Now that you have added your module folder, configuration, source and added it to the targets,
you should now go back to the root folder of your project and right click the `.uproject` file.
Then select `Generate Visual Studio project files...`
to regenerate the VS-Solution now with your module.

You should then be able to start working on your {cpp} code for your mod.

[WARNING]
====
Make always sure you code in a custom created module!
Never code in any other module!
====

== Adding a Class

When you want to add a class you have mainly two safe ways to go.

1. Navigate to the folder were you want to add your class in the windows explorer
and create the `.cpp`-File and the `.h`-File manually.
Fill them with a template code or just directly the class you need.
2. Open the unreal editor and open the "tree view" of the content browser.
Then navigate to the `C++-Classes` root folder and open the folder named with your mod reference.
In there r-click into empty space and hit `New {cpp}-Class`.
Then select your desired base class, hit next and name your class.
Change the other settings as your desire and finish with `create class`.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure you rly select your custom {cpp}-module!
