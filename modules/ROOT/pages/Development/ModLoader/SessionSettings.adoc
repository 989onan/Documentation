Introduced in SML3.5, Session Settings are a feature similar to Advanced Game Settings that allows mods to store configuration information on a per-game-save basis.

Mods can define Session Settings in their
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_instance_bound_module_ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance Module].

TODO verify
Session settings are stored in the session settings subsystem https://discord.com/channels/555424930502541343/562722670974599227/1126996669481889903

Session Settings can optionally be marked as TODO, meaning that they will be stored (uncompressed) in the Unreal session URL as part of the save header. This means their values will be loaded as soon as the game mode is initalized and before world actors are initalized.
