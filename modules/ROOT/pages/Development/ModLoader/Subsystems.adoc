= Subsystems

[TIP]

If you're looking for the subsystems that SML provides by default,
check out the
xref:Development/ModLoader/Registry.adoc[Registry page].

Subsystems are actors that exist only once in the world
(similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern[Singletons], but not quite)
as an instance general manager. These subsystems are accessible from anywhere you
have a world context available (f.e. actors).
Subsystems allow you to implement custom game state information,
for example, that you want to have saved to the save file, or when you
want to manage multiple actors or some system from one central point.

For example, the mod Light It Up uses subsystems to create a lamp group system.
With this system, every lamp can get information about the current group settings
without storing that data again in each lamp instance.


== Spawning a Subsystem

A subsystem itself is an actor inheriting from `SML.ModSubsystem`.
You can also use subsystems to store data to save states.

The subsystem should be registered as a property in `SML.GameWorldModule`

You should use the `GetSubsystemActor` function to reference your subsystem.

* The first parameter of the function is a reference to your `SubsystemActorManager` acquired using the function `GetSubsystemActorManager`.
* The second parameter is just a name for the actor in this example `ExampleSubsystem`.
