= Upgrading from SML 3.4.x to 3.5

== Why the Plugins to Mods change?

- Real™️ Official™️ mods will be in the Mods folder instead of Plugins, when they eventually™️ come out
- Previously, Alpakit was already remapping mods from the Plugins folder to Mods behind the scenes.
- This move is just preparation for that well in advance

== What steps to take:

1. Move your mod folders from your `%SML_Project_Folder%\Plugins` to `%SML_Project_Folder%\Mods`.

* SML 3.4.x SML\Plugins Locations:

* SML 3.5.x SML\Mods Locations:

2. link:BeginnersGuide\project_setup.html#_project_compilation[Compile your project like normal.]

3. Congratulations! You are now up to date, and can continue modding as normal.
Just remember that mods go in the `<SF_Install>\FactoryGame\Mods` folder now!
Alpakit's "copy mods" feature has already been updated to account for this.
