= Schematics

Schematics are Coffee Stain Studios answer to research.
Schematics hold information about requirements, visuals and rewards of research milestones.

Everything that is technical progress ingame is a schematic.
From the analyzing stuff of the M.A.M over the HUB Upgrades to the Tier Stages of the Space Elevator, everything is a Schematic.

The requrements of a schematic are directly set in the schematic, but the rewards are defined by so called "unlocks".
These unlocks can be everything from new recipes over new buildings to now inventory slots.
