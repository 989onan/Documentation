= In-Game Clipboard

Satisfactory offers a clipboard functionality to copy-paste configuration options between machines.
It's possible to extend this functionality to work with your own custom buildings.

The `AFGBuildable` class already implements the `IFGFactoryClipboardInterface` interface, the interface defining the functions that must be overridden to implement clipboard functionality, so listing this interface an extra time is not necessary.

1. Create a class with basetype `FGFactoryClipboardSettings` and add variables for the stuff you want to save in the clipboard
2. Override the `GetClipboardSettingsClass` function and set the return value to your class
3. Override the `GetClipboardMappingClass` and set the return value to the class of object that uses this clipboard
4. Override the `CanUseFactoryClipboard` function to return true
5. Override the copy and paste functions and implement your own logic
