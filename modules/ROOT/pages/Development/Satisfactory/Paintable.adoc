= Paintable

Making things paintable is not that difficult as it seems. You can use
the standard way, or create your implementation.

== Standard Material

The standard material (MI_Factory_Base_01) used by SF is the best way to implement the ability
to paint.

It gets implemented by the `FGBuildable`-class und changes the primary
and secondary material parameters of the material. You can
find it in the content browser under
`+Content/FactoryGame/-Shared/Material+`.

This material implements also multiple other surface materials. It works
as an atlas map.

This is a simplified representative atlas map for the material you can
use to UV map your models.

== Custom implementation

You can implement the ability to paint in any object by implementing the
`IFGColorInterface`. Simply override the given functions with the
functionality you need and you're done!

The paint gun will now interact with your object, it can do this by
using the reflection system.
