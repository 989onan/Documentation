= Paintable

Making things paintable is not as difficult as it may seem. You can use
the standard way, or create your own implementation.

== Standard Material

Making use of the standard material (`Factory_Inst`) used by SF is the easiest way to make your models paintable.

To use it, make your models pull their colors from this material file.

It gets implemented by the `FGBuildable` class and changes the primary and secondary material parameters of the material. You can find it in the content browser under
`+Content/FactoryGame/Buildable/-Shared/Material+`.

This material also implements multiple other surface materials you can use. It works as an atlas map.

== Custom implementation

You can implement the ability to paint in any object by implementing the
`IFGColorInterface`. Simply override the given functions with the functionality you need and you're done. Consider asking about this on the Discord or forums if you need help.

The paint gun will now interact with your object, which is done via the reflection system.
