This page is a work in progress. When complete, it will cover:

- What checking the save game checkbox actually does, and that you need to do so for data to be saved
- That you need to implement the IFGSaveGame Interface
- What Unreal serialization is and what you need be aware of (how it works just in short)
- What the counterparts are in C++
- Where to find the save game file
