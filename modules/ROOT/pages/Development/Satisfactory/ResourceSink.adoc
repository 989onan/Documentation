= Resource Sink

Right now you were not able to put custom items into the resource sink
to gather coupon points.

SML provides a facility for you to load a list of item descriptors
referred with their new associated count of coupon points you get
when you recycle the item for the first time.

== Data Table

If you want to define the amount of coupon points,
you will need to create a data table with
`Resource Sink Point Data` as type of row.

In the data table now add for each item descriptor you want to add
a new row, select for `Item Class` your descriptor
and change `Points` to the amount of coupons you want.

With that the data we need is fully created.

== Registering the Data Table

Now we just need to tell SF to load the contents of the data table.
We do this by using the InitMod actor.
Simply set the `M Resource Sink Item Points Data Table` variable in the defaults tab
to your own just created data table.
SML will read the contents and adds them to the resource sink.
