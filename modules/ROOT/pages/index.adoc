Welcome to the Satisfactory Modding Documentation site! Here you can
find lots of information regarding modding
https://www.satisfactorygame.com/[Satisfactory], the factory-building
sim by Coffee Stain Studios. Modding for Satisfactory is more
established than you might think given how long the game has been out.
There are already numerous mods released, and there are multiple methods
by which you can develop new mods yourself. In this doc we will mainly
focus on the general community, ficsit.app and SML.

If you want to take part in this great community, we recommend you to

Satisfactory Mod Repository
(aka. SMR aka. ficsit.app aka. FICSIT Augmentation Database)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' The
Satisfactory Mod Repository (SMR) is the most extensive collection of
mods made for Satisfactory. It's easy to upload a mod of your own or
write a guide for other users. Uploaded content gets test for malware
and other stuff. Visit https://ficsit.app/[ficsit.app] to learn more.

Satisfactory Mod Loader (aka. SML)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML) allows Satisfactory to load additional
content and is essential in making most mods work. SML provides two key
features.

* Loading and initializing mods directly from "pak" files
* Loading and initializing native mods written in C++

If you're looking to write your own mods, we suggest you start with
making pak mods. Learn more in our beginners_guide/index guide.

Installing Mods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you just want to install mods, this section of the guide is for you.
First of all, you need to pick a mod that you want to install! Take a
look on https://ficsit.app/[SMR]. Please note that there are multiple
pages of mods you can navigate through with the arrows at the bottom
right. You should always *read the mod description* because some mods
have different installation instructions that need to be followed, such
as KronosMod. If you don't do this, the mod won't work! Most likely the
mod you choose will require you to install SML; we will guide you how to
do that.

Install SML
^^^^^^^^^^^

Again visit https://ficsit.app/[ficsit.app] and open up the menu through
the menu button in the upper left hand corner. Select the `SML Releases`
tab and click on the `View` button on the _Latest Release_ box (top
left). You should now get redirected to the SML GitHub page. Click on
the `xinput1_3.dll` download link under _Assets_ and save it to your
downloads folder. Follow the instructions there to install, or follow
the instructions below.

Now open up your Satisfactory installation folder. Most of the times its
in your program folder under `EpicGames/SatisfactoryEarlyAccess`. Follow
the folders `Binaries` and `Win64`. Now just copy the `xinput1_3.dll`
into that folder.

Congrats! The first step is done, installing SML. Now, start up
Satisfactory and verify that a `mods` folder gets created in your
Satisfactory directory.

Installing Your Mod of Choice ''''''''''''''''''''' Ok, back to the mod
itself. On ficsit.app you just go to your desired mod's page, click on
`versions` in the upper right left corner and then click `download` on
your desired version. Usually this will be the top version on the list.

Always check to make sure that the _SML Version_ column for the version
you choose matches the version of SML you have installed. You can
attempt to install the mod with mismatched versions, but most of the
time, it won't work.

Save the zip file to your downloads folder and then open it with a
proper zip archive explorer like 7zip. It contains multiple files, which
include some but not necessarily all of the following:

* data.json::
  Used by SMR to identify the mod. You don't need to do anything with
  this file.
* .pak files::
  These files contain some mod logic, models, textures and so on. To
  install them you need to copy them again into the Satisfactory
  installation folder, but this time under `Content\Paks` Each `.pak`
  file should have a `.sig` file with a matching name. If there is no
  corresponding `.sig`-file for each of the `.pak` files in the archive,
  you'll need to copy the `.sig` file used by Satisfactory (it's called
  `FactoryGame.sig`) and rename it to match the `.pak` file you're
  copying in. Repeat this step for each `.pak` file there is.
* .sig files::
  See above. Copy them to the same place as the `.pak` files if you
  haven't done so already.
* .dll files::
  These files contain mod logic but interact with the game differently
  from `.pak` files and are installed differently. Copy these files into
  the `mods` folder. If you don't have this folder, you forgot to run
  Satisfactory after installing SML.

Installing Mod Dependencies '''''''''''''''''''''''''' Some mods, such
as the Farming Mod, will require you to install other mods in order for
them to work. *Read the mod description* on the SMR page to find out if
the mod you're installing requires any other mods! People will be very
frustrated if you ask them for help and you haven't followed this simple
step.

If you see this message, you forgot to install the Satisfactory Item
Dictionary mod, a common dependency. Go find it on SMR and install it!
