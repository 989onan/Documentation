== How do I install mods?

=== For Windows 10:

image:FAQ/win10_install_smm_guide.png[Steps to install SMM on Windows 10]

=== For Windows 11:

The installation process should be similar to that of Windows 10, but if you encounter a popup like this:

image:FAQ/win11_subtle_block.png[Windows 11 "Search for app in store?" popup for untrusted installers]

Ignore it because it is not correct. Instead, right-click on the installer in your file manager and go to the properties tab.

image:FAQ/smm_installer_properties_unblock.png[The properties window for the SMM installer]

Click the "Unblock" box and hit OK or Apply. Then try running it again, and it should work. Refer to the above illustration
for the rest of the steps.

== The mod manager can't find my game!

You might see error messages like:
- `No Satisfactory Installs Found`

SMM queries the APIs of the Epic and Steam game store apps to determine where your game is.
If you moved its location after installation manually, your installer client will not know where it is.

You will need to reinstall your game through your store client so that it is in a known location.

This will not affect your saves.

== Can I add mods to a save I've already started?

It varies depending on the mod, but in general, yes, this is totally fine.
The mod should say on its mod page on ficsit.app if it can't be added to an in-progress game.

== Do mods work with multiplayer?

It is up to the mod developer to support multiplayer.
Check the mod's page on ficsit.app for information about multiplayer support.

If the mod page doesn't say, try it out yourself and see!

== Are Satisfactory mods safe?

_Or: 'Why does Satisfactory Mod Manager trigger my antivirus?'_

Using Satisfactory mods is safe, as long as you only download mods from ficsit.app and install them via the https://smm.ficsit.app/[Mod Manager].

All files uploaded to ficsit.app are tested for malware and such before they are approved for download.

Your computer may claim that the Mod Manager is unsafe when you try to open it.
This is because the mod manager does not have a
https://comodosslstore.com/resources/what-is-signing-certificate/[signing certificate].
The certificate costs hundreds per year.
It's completely unnecessary for normal operation, and not worth it to pay for it.

But rest assured, this community created Satisfactory Mod Manager from scratch.
We all use it. Provided you only get it via https://smm.ficsit.app/ we can assure you it is safe.
You can find the source code for it here: https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager

== How do I use <insert mod name here>?

It is up to the mod developer to inform you how to use their mod.
Check the mod's page on ficsit.app for documentation.

Generally, most mods will require you to unlock something in the HUB or MAM before you can use them.
Mods can be configured from the 'Mods' tab on the main menu,
or from in-game via the 'Mod Configs' tab on the pause menu.

== Do mods work with Experimental?

It is up to the mod developer to support Satisfactory's experimental branch.
Check the mod's page on ficsit.app, or the mod manager extended details, for support.

Once you're on the page, check mods' Compatibility via two stickers found in the description.
The rocket icon indicates Early Access and the flask icon is for Experimental.

In the Mod Manager:

On ficsit.app:

You can hover over the sticker for any notes that may have been left by the author.
They may indicate a version to use, which you can change to in the Mod Manager with the dropdown right above the stickers.

- *Green - Working*:
  The mod should be functioning as intended.
- *Yellow/Orange - Damaged*:
  Something is wrong with the mod that is causing it to work improperly,
  but it is partially working.
  Be sure to click the icon to see an explanation of what is going wrong!
- *Red - Broken*:
  This mod is suffering from a critical problem,
  and could do things like crash your game at launch if you were to install it.
  Be sure to click the icon to see an explanation of what is going wrong!

Please note, these are updated manually, and may be slightly out of date.
If you find a mod that is missing its stickers or ones that seem to be incorrect,
please let us know in the Discord (including a SMM debug zip if it does not work is useful as well!)
and we will investigate and update the info if necessary.

== Satisfactory Mod Manager is open, but I can't see it's window!

The program's window somehow got offscreen.
We're still not sure what causes this.
To fix it you need to edit the `%appdata%\SatisfactoryModManager\settings.json` file
and within the `windowLocation` property, set the `x` and `y` to 0 to bring the window back on the screen.

Restart SMM after you do that.

== Where do I get help with a mod that is not in the mod portal?

We try to keep everything we work on organized through the ficsit.app mod portal.
If you need help with something that isn't there,
check the mod's information page for a mod-specific discord to join,
or ask nicely in the `#help-using-mods` discord channel.

== What happens if I open up a save without mods installed?

If you were to load up a save file without mods,
all of the content from those mods will simply vanish from the save,
and the game should load just fine with no modded content.

Keep in mind that after saving the game after loading it with no mods,
the modded content would be permanently gone from that point on.
So, if you want to keep modded content, don't play in that save without your mods installed!

If you ever load a save without mods by accident,
just quit the game without saving and launch the game with your mods, your content should still be there.

== How do I make my own mod?

If you're looking to write your own mods, we suggest you start with
making blueprint mods first rather than C++ mods.
Check out the xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/index.adoc[Getting Started Guide]
and consider picking up the `Aspiring Modder` role in our https://discord.gg/xkVJ73E[Discord]'s `#rules` channel.

== How do I share my mods with my friends for multiplayer?

You can use the Mod Manager's profile import/export functionality.

== Where can I find the game's log files?

You can find various log files at different locations:

- In your game install folder, `pre-launch-debug.log` and `SatisfactoryModLoader.log`
- At `%localappdata%/FactoryGame/Saved/logs`, where FactoryGame.log is located

The easiest way to gather logs is the Mod Manager's "generate debug info" feature:

== How do I verify my game files?

On Steam:

On Epic:

== Why is the mod manager downloading slowly, or failing to download?

You might see error messages like:

// cspell:words getaddrinfo ENOENT ECONNRESET
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: getaddrinfo ENOENT github.com`
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: read ECONNRESET`
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: unable to verify the first certificate`
- `Unexpected error while downloading file: self signed certificate in certificate chain`

Internet restrictions, and sometimes VPNs and proxies, mess with our services.
To work around this, download the mod files mentioned in the error message from SMR manually.
If they are named `[modname].zip` rename them to `[modname].smod`, then place the file into 
`%localappdata%\SatisfactoryModManager\downloadCache\smlVersions\[the SML version you need]` for SML and
`%localappdata%\SatisfactoryModManager\downloadCache\mods` for everything else.

You can also try using a proxy or VPN.

== The mod manager can't download any mods

You might see messages like:

// cspell:words ETIMEDOUT
- `error while downloading file [...] Premature close`
- `Error 3 attempts to download <ModName> failed`
- `Error: Unexpected error while downloading file connect ETIMEDOUT`

Your internet speed is likely too slow and the download is being cut off early.
Try disabling the mod manager's timeout as shown below.

== How can I troubleshoot crash issues?

The easiest way to gather logs is the Mod Manager's "generate debug info" feature and send the file on the Modding Discord's `#help-using-mods` discord channel.

image:https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719242895114108938/1089039840512852019/debuginfo.png[SMM Generate Debug Info screenshot]

You can also follow this process to track down which mod(s) you have installed are leading to a crash (or other undesired behavior):

== How can I tell what mod added an item/milestone/recipe/thing?

Consider using https://ficsit.app/mod/TFIT[TFIT - The Ficsit Information Tool]
and https://ficsit.app/mod/MAMTips[MAM Enhancer]
mods which add tools to help you identify content.

== I'm having VRAM issues, how do I fix them?

If you're having trouble with VRAM usage
it's important to understand the two things that are the biggest contributions:
graphics settings and texture content.
Other things contribute, but there are a smaller fraction than these. 
Additionally, with multiple monitors and/or other programs running,
they will also eat up available VRAM,
so consider closing extraneous programs
especially things that are highly dynamic like streaming apps.

The more mods you use that add more texture content,
the more they will eat up your VRAM.
This is a direct relationship that can't be change by any settings or details from the user's end.
It is unlikely to be a single mod causing the problem.
It is a death by a thousand small cuts
and every mod author has to do their best,
but more content means more space is used.

If removing mod content is not desirable the other option is to adjust your graphics settings.
Even at minimum there are extensive options Unreal provides for you to tune it even lower.
These may cause unforeseen glitches and issues so be careful with them.

== Can I put the Mod Manager on a drive other than my C drive?

In order to change the location where SMM caches the downloaded mod files you need to create a symlink for the SMM cache folder.

1. Close SMM
2. Move the folder `%localappdata%\SatisfactoryModManager` to a drive that has enough space. You can rename the folder to something like SMMCache if you want to make it easier to remember what that folder is.
3. Open Command Prompt as admin and run this command `mklink /D "%localappdata%\SatisfactoryModManager" "The\New\Location"`, replacing `The\New\Location` with the path of the new folder location (for example `D:\SMMCache`).
4. Open SMM and download a mod to test and make sure the change has taken effect.
