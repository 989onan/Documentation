= UField

A xref:#_ufield[UField] is a UObject mainly containing an attribute
`+next+` pointing to the next xref:#_ufield[UField] instance.

== Next

The next attribute points to the next xref:#_ufield[UField] in a row.
Each xref:#_ufield[UField] points to the next one until it reaches
nullptr. This creates a chain of [.title-ref]#UFields#.
