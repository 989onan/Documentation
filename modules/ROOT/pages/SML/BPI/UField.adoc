UField
------

A link:[UField] is a UObject mainly containing an attribute `next`
pointing to the next link:[UField] instance.

[[next]]
Next
~~~~

The next attribute points to the next link:[UField] in a row. Each
link:[UField] points to the next one until it reaches nullptr. This
creates a chain of UFields.
