= Blue-Print Interface

The BPI provides multiple helper classes and functions for manipulating
the reflection system of unreal.

== The Problem

Unreal uses a reflection system to have mainly a proper interface to
there visual scripting language called Blueprint. If you want now to add
something to this reflection system you were not able to do this through
the `+Unreal Header Tool+` which provides features for Unreal C++ Devs
to create easily proper reflection system interfaces. This is
problematic especially if you want to integrate third-party libraries or
make your code way more performant.

== The Solution

The BPI uses the same interface as the `+Unreal Header Tool+` uses but
wraps this interface into easy to use builder classes. Through this you
can:

* Attach custom functions to existing `+UObjects+`
* Creating custom `+UClasses+`
* Creating custom functions
* and many more

== General

The BPI is located under `+assets/BPInterface.h+` in the SML root and
also provides better structures as the SDK under `+util/Objects+`

[WARNING]
====
We heavily recommend using the BPI objects instead of the SDK ones cause
the SDK is auto-generated and provides less save implementations.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please build/attach things with the provided BuilderClasses only in on
`+UGameEngine::Start+`. Hook it if needed.
