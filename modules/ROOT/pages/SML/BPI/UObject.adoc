= UObject

A xref:#_uobject[UObject] is the most basic thing in the unreal
reflection system. Heck, it even gave the system a name, the
`+UObject-System+` which is found in the `+UObjectCore+` of the unreal
engine. Every xref:#_uobject[Uobject] contains flags and pointers to
information which describes the object itself (not the class/type).

== Flags

The object flags describe their properties. (f.e. if it's abstract)

== Class

Every xref:#_uobject[UObject] has a valid attribute `+clazz+` which
points to the UClass describing the class/type of the
xref:#_uobject[UObject]
