[[uobject]]
UObject
-------

A link:[UObject] is the most basic thing in the unreal reflection
system. Heck, it even gave the system a name, the `UObject-System` which
is found in the `UObjectCore` of the unreal engine. Every link:[Uobject]
contains flags and pointers to information which describes the object
itself (not the class/type).

[[flags]]
Flags
~~~~~

The object flags describe their properties. (f.e. if it's abstract)

[[class]]
Class
~~~~~

Every link:[UObject] has a valid attribute `clazz` which points to the
UClass describing the class/type of the link:[UObject]
