[[ustruct]]
UStruct
-------

A UStruct is simply a special data structure which can hold multiple
link:UField[UFields] and is self a link:[UField]. These children
describe the instance and its contents like datatypes, array lengths and
so on.

[[children]]
Children
~~~~~~~~

These children are simply a row of references until the reference of one
UField is equal to nullptr. The first child in that row is referred by
the `childs` attribute.

[[iterating-over-children]]
Iterating over children
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As already said, the children of a UStruct are additional information of
a UStruct about its f.e. functions, attributes and components. Each of
those are represented through an instance of an UField . Important to
note is that each UField points with the `next` attribute to next one of
the class. Iterating is simply following this next-pointer until it
reaches nullptr.

[source,sourceCode,c++]
----
UStruct* struc;
UField* field = struc->childs;
while (field) {
    // Do something with the field
    field = field->next;
}
----

If you want to also iterate overextended fields, you will need to switch
to the superclass when the field pointer reaches nullptr.

[source,sourceCode,c++]
----
UStruct* struc;
UField* field = struc->childs;
while(field || clazz) {
    if (!field) {
        struc = (UStruct*) struc->super;
        field = struc->childs;
        continue;
    }
    // do stuff
    field = field->next;
}
----

and because this is so much to write the `SML::Objects::UStruct`
implements a C++ iterator. With that said you can use a c++ for-each
loop to iterate over the fields of a UStruct recursively with following
code:

[source,sourceCode,c++]
----
UStruct* struc;
for (UField* field : *struc) {
    // do stuff
}
----

[[inheritance]]
Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the superclass of an UClass just simply follow the `super`
attribute. It contains the pointer to inherited UStruct. Multiple
inheritances are not possible.
