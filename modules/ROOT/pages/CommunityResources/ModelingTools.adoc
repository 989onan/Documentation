Community member AngryBeaver maintains a repository of re-modeled 'pieces'
of base Satisfactory buildings that are quite useful in creating your own
factory building models. 

These re-models have been optimized to have fewer vertices than the
pieces of machines that one could take off of Satisfactory machines
exported via UModel, and they still look great!

You can read more about the Modeling Tools on its
