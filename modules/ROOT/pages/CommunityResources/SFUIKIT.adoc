= SFUIKIT

Community members Deantendo and Treelo maintain a "build your own" UI kit
that can be used to help integrate your mod's UI with Satisfactory's.
The files are vector-based and will require Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 or later to open.

You can get the files and read more on 
the UI kit's https://github.com/deantendo/sfuikit[GitHub page].
