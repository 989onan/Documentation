"Modding is not just about the programming / scripting side" - Pleasure 2020
====

This section is a continual work in progress,
and will contain information about and links to resources helpful for creating
models, textures, user interfaces, and the other content for your mod.
Many of these resources have been made or gathered by the community,
and if you'd like to list another resource here or write a guide,
feel free to pull request the docs repo (press Edit This Page in the top right corner)
or contact us on the Discord with suggestions.

[NOTE]
====
The `#modding-resources` channel on the Discord has additional resources that you may find helpful.
